2) Below are the guidelines for latex math blocks
Inline equations:
* Always use `$` to wrap inline equations (e.g., `$y = ax + b$`).
* Do not use `\\(\\)` for inline equations (e.g., `\\(\\mathbf{X}^T (\\mathbf{X} \\vec{\\theta} - \\vec{y})\\)` is incorrect).
* Ensure there are no spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

Standalone equations:
* Always wrap standalone equations with `$$` (e.g., `$$ y = ax + b $$`).
